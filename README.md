Logic used

Filtering the duplicate References: Tried to add the refrences in a set which doesn't allow me to add any, if there is reference already present in it. These records has been extracted to a seperate list as duplicate refrences and assinged the repective status.

End Balance Mismatch records: Added the start balance with the mutation to get a sum which is compared against the end balance received. All the records which are mismateched are extracted to a list and assinged the repective status.
